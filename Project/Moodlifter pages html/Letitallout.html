		Let it all out
		<br>
		<br>
		Anxiety is interesting, because it tends<br>
		to get worse when you try to fight it. It's<br>
		not clear why that occurs, but most likely the<br>
		stress that your body goes through in order<br>
		to control the stress of anxiety only makes it<br>
		worse, as does the effort it takes to try to not<br>
		feel your natural feelings.<br>
		<br>
		So rather than have any desire to stop your anxiety,<br>
		an interesting coping strategy is to go overboard<br>
		embracing it. I like to call it the "going crazy"<br>
		technique. When you're feeling anxious, find a place<br>
		that you can be alone and go nuts. Yell at mirrors.<br>
		Scream. Punch pillows. In a way, make fun of the<br>
		things you wish you can do. Have a bit of fun with<br>
		it, but also let out all of your emotions. Throw <br>
		stuffed animals. Flail your arms and jump around. <br>
		Let yourself feel like you're letting out all of your<br>
		emotions, and then some, to the point where you feel<br>
		a bit silly, and then keep going with it.<br>
		<br>
		This lets you embrace the anxiety and not try to fight<br>
		it, while also giving you an opportunity to hold it back.<br>
