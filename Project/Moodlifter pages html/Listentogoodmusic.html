		Listen to good music
		<br>
		<br>
		Every little thing matters. That's why<br>
		even if it sounds like it won't make a<br>
		tremendous difference, listening to your<br>
		favorite music can have a powerful effect on<br>
		your anxiety. They key is to not just choose<br>
		songs you like, however. The key is also to<br>
		make sure you're listening to music that<br>
		represents the way you want to feel. Happy or<br>
		relaxing music, not just any music.<br>
		<br>
		The reality is that music does affect emotions.<br>
		So while many people find it soothing to listen <br>
		to angry music when you're angry or sad music<br>
		when you're sad, the truth is that this type of<br>
		music will only help you get in touch with those<br>
		negative emotions. They won't help you feel better.<br>
		When you're trying to stop anxiety now, you should<br>
		listen to music that will help you feel the way you<br>
		want to feel.<br>
