		Be in the present
		<br>
		<br>
		Finally, simply learning to live for today<br>
		can impact your anxiety. One of the most <br>
		important things that psychologists and <br>
		counselors teach those with anxiety is:<br>
			"Okay, you're anxious. So what?"<br>
		<br>
		Those with anxiety often start to focus too<br>
		much on how they feel and their worries about <br>
		the future. Each day becomes trying to live with<br>
		anxiety instead of trying to live in general. <br>
		Learning to embrace the idea that you have anxiety<br>
		and trying to live a great and exciting life anyway<br>
		is important.<br>
		<br>
		And what's interesting is that if you can learn to<br>
		finally have that mindset to let yourself experience<br>
		the fear and try to live the life anyway - you will find <br>
		that your anxiety tends to dissipate with it. It's not a<br>
		cure, but it's close.<br>
