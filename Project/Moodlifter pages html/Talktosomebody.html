		Talk to Somebody

		<br>
		Effective anxiety reduction is often<br>
		about distraction, since your mind can<br>
		be your worst enemy when you have severe<br>
		anxiety symptoms. A very effective<br>
		technique is to talk to someone you like<br>
		and trust, especially on the phone. Don't<br>
		be shy about your anxiety,tell them you <br>
		feel anxious and explain what you're feeling.
	<br>
		Talking to nice people keeps your mind off<br>
		of your symptoms, and the supportive nature<br>
		of friends and family gives you that added<br>
		boost of confidence. If you're suffering from<br>
		a panic attack, it also helps you feel more<br>
		confident that if something was wrong, you'd <br>
		have someone that can watch over you.<br>
