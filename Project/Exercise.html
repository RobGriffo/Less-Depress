		Exercise
		<br>
		<br>
		During periods of anxiety your body <br>
		is filled with adrenaline. Putting that<br>
		adrenaline towards exercise can<br>
		be a great way to improve your anxiety.<br>
		That's because exercise has numerous<br>
		advantages for controlling your anxiety<br>
		symptoms:<br>
		<br>
			- Exercise burns away stress hormones<br>
			  that create anxiety symptoms.<br>
			<br>
			- Exercise tires your muscles, reducing<br>
			  excess energy and tension.<br>
			<br>
			- Exercise releases endorphins which<br>
			  improve overall mood.<br>
			<br>
			- Exercise forces healthier breathing.<br>
			<br>
			- Exercise is a healthy distraction.<br>
			<br>
			Light jogging or even fast walking, can<br>
			be extremely effective at reducing the<br>
			severity of your anxiety symptoms, as well<br>
			as your anxiety itself.<br>
