		Trick your anxiety
		<br>
		<br>
		Anxiety doesn't come out of the blue.,<br>
		When you have anxiety attacks, it's often<br>
		because your mind has a tendency to spiral<br>
		into negative thoughts, often without your<br>
		control. Sometimes you can control this anxiety<br>
		by keeping these thoughts at bay, and learning to<br>
		dismiss triggers that cause you anxiety.<br>
		<br>
		For many, this is easier said than done.<br>
		But there are many different strategies you can<br>
		try that may be effective. These include:<br>
		<br>
		A Question Checklist<br>
		When you feel severe anxiety, have a checklist<br>
		on hand of questions to ask yourself about that<br>
		anxiety experience. The longer the checklist, the<br>
		more you'll find that your thoughts become more<br>
		realistic. Questions that you can use include:<br>
		<br>
			- Is there a reason to believe something is wrong?<br>
			<br>
			- What evidence is there that something is wrong?<br>
			<br>
			- Is there a chance I'm blowing this out of proportion?<br>
