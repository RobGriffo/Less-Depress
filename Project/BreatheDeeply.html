		Breathe Deeply
		<br>
		<br>
		It's not what you think.<br>
		Even if you feel you can't take<br>
		a deep breath, you actually need to slow<br>
		down and reduce your breathing, not<br>
		speed it up or try to take deeper<br>
		breaths. Take more controlled, slower,<br>
		shallower breaths, using the<br>
		following technique:<br>
		<br>
		- Breathe in slowly and gently<br>
		through your nose<br>
		for about 5 to 7 seconds.<br>
		<br>
		- Hold for about three or four seconds.<br>
		<br>
		- Breathe out slowly and gently<br>
		through pursed<br>
		lips like you're whistling for<br>
		about 7 to 9 seconds.<br>
		<br>
		Repeat this exercise ten to twenty<br>
		times. This method of breathing will ensure<br>
		that you're not hyperventilating.
